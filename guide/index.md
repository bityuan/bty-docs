# BitYuan Introduction

>BitYuan is an open source, decentralized, public network blockchain project, which dedicated to creating a public chain federation. With the addition of Bityuan nodes, performance is enhanced, driving the blockchain to become a stable and efficient cloud service.


## What is BitYuan？ 

The distributed ledger and token-incentivized timestamp system represented by Bitcoin is widely believed to be expected to become the pillar of future finance. For an emerging technology, only continuous technical upgrading and optimization, perfecting functions and improving performance can be recognized by the market and widely applied to the ground, thus leading an era of change.

In December 2013, BitYuan was officially born. BitYuan is a simple, stable and highly scalable public chain network with the main goal of achieving decentralized governance and creating a super strong public chain federation. The core of BitYuan is as stable as Bitcoin, but also flexible and efficient in terms of scalability. Developers can build a powerful DApp and multi-chain ecosystem on BitYuan and work together to maintain the BitYuan system. On the BitYuan platform, you can pay, receive, and store multiple tokens, support wallet retrieval, collateralized token issuance, cross-chain transactions, and many other functions.

Based on the underlying architecture of Chain33 blockchain, Bityuan is the world's first public chain project that has realized a multi-chain (parallel public chain) architecture. Bityuan blockchain can develop multiple public chains in parallel, and each parallel public chain can both independently develop and deploy DAPPs to build a diverse application ecology and realize cross-chain transactions between multiple chains.

**Value**

To provide basic services for all parallel public chains, BitYuan tokens are used as the necessary base fuel for all exchanges of parallel public chains (burn to destruction).

**Development History**

- 2013.12,Bityuan project started.
- 2014.5,Bityuan mainnet transforming transformed into the POS consensus mechanism from POW.
- 2018.5,Bityuan mainnet upgradeds POS consensus mechanism to SPOS. Tthe first parallel chain architecture landedwas created and executed for the first time.
- 2019.1,Bityuan mainnet supported for multiple signatures, addinged JSVM supportfunction.
- 2019.6,Bityuan mainnet launched the parachain super node function.
- 2019.9,Bityuan mainnet launched Development Fund decentralized governance.
- 2020.7,Bityuan mainnet, added the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) network.
- 2020.11,Bityuan officially connected to the BSN platform and becaomes one of the preferred public chains for developers.
- 2021.5,Bityuan mainnet supported split sharding nodes to realize lightweight mainnetwork and lay the foundation for expansion.
- 2022.3,Add cross-chain function with Ethereum chains, including bsc, heco, eth and etc.Achieve privacy transfers with Zero—Knowledge Proof.DAO Optimization.

**The future**

- Scaling: Optimize sharding nodes to achieve greater scaling.
- Zk-Sharks: implement Privacy-preserving computation and cross-chain protocol on the chain.
- Performance: improve the performance of database storage and optimize the application scenario.

**Open Source**

On December 7, 2018, the underlying architecture code of BitYuan was officially open sourced to the world on Github.

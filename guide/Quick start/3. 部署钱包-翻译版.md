## Create wallet


1. Generate random number seed. We suggest that users should generate the seed in person and keep it manually since it can be used to recover wallet.
```  
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 seed generate -l 0 --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"  
```  
--parameter[rpc_laddr] means the rpc address of the chain that users remote call. (it can be modified based on the real monitoring jrpc address of users, marked as "jrpcBindAddr" in configuration file.)

2. Save seeds, and create password for wallet.
```  
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 seed save -p "wallet's password" -sÂ "the created seeds from last step" --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"  
```  
The password can be customerized. (More than 8 digits, combination of letters and numbers, such as fzm12345) Remember your password, which is used to unlock your wallet.


3. Unlock wallet.
```
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 wallet unlock -p "wallet's password" -t 0 --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"
```  
-p is password for wallet, -t is time for automatic wallet lock, -o means never lock unless restart. 

4. (Optional) Check the wallet status.
```
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 wallet status --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"
```  
the following information means create and unlock the wallet successfully. 
```
{
    "isWalletLock": false,
    "isAutoMining": false,
    "isHasSeed": true,
    "isTicketLock": true
}```


## Create account address and private key
1. Create account.  
```
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 account create -l doctest --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"
```  
-l is the account name.  
After creating, the following information is returned: 
```  
{
    "acc": {
        "balance": "0.0000",
        "frozen": "0.0000",
        "addr": "19ZuTYqWQzsH6p****uyosFWqPg5B"
    },
    "label": "doctest"
}  
```

2. Inquire private key for the account.
```  
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 account dump_key -a "account address" --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"  
```    
Return the following information:   
```
{
    "data": "0x9b202dab67e33f*******02ca138095280c11502f77a"
}  
```

3. (Optional) Inquire all account information.  
```  
./chain33-cli-linux-amd64 account list --rpc_laddr="http://localhost:8901"  
```  
Return the following information:
```  
{
    "wallets": [
        {
            "acc": {
                "balance": "0.0000",
                "frozen": "0.0000",
                "addr": "19ZuTYqWQzsH6pP****uyosFWqPg5B"
            },
            "label": "doctest"
        },
    ]
}  
```

# Smart Contract

Smart Contract, a program deployed on the blockchain network, automates the processing of contracts in the form of computer instructions. Smart contract developers can specify the contract content in advance, and when the contract trigger conditions are met, the program will automatically execute the contract content.

## Smart Contract Language ##

Smart contracts actually have their own ecology, and most of them are currently written in solidity with Etherpad. If a new blockchain system is not compatible with this ecology, then it may encounter resistance when promoting its application.

BitYuan's smart contract module is pluggable and also supports a diverse range of smart contract languages, including established development languages such as Solidity, Java, C++ and Golang.

## Smart Contract Library ##
Customers do not need to develop every smart contract in their project from scratch, BitYuan already provides many smart contracts for users to use directly.
